# 🍕 Pizza Restaurant App

A simple web application where users can order pizza and track their order status in real time.  
This project was built to practice modern React development concepts like **React Router Data APIs**, **Redux Toolkit (with Thunk middleware)**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app simulates an online pizza ordering experience:
- Browse a menu of pizzas
- Add or remove pizzas from the cart
- Submit an order
- Track your order

The focus of this project is **learning**, not production readiness.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **React 19**
- **React Router 7** (loaders, actions, data fetching)
- **Redux Toolkit** (state management)
- **Thunk middleware** (async actions)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
- **Vite 7** (development & build tool)

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Practice working with **React Router’s data APIs** (`loaders`, `actions`)
- Manage global state using **Redux Toolkit slices**
- Handle async operations with **thunk middleware**
- Build responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS**
- Configure a clean development environment with **Vite**, **ESLint**, and **Prettier**
